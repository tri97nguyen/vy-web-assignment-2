                        <h2>Arabica</h2>
                        <p>Arabica is the world's most common coffee bean. High-quality Arabica comes from Brazil, Colombia,
                            Ethiopia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and India. Arabica tends to have a subtle,
                            sweet flavor with hints of chocolate, caramel,
                            nuts or berries. It's also more expensive than Robusta, but the two are often mixed together in
                            coffee blends. Is Arabica better than Robusta? Real-deal coffee snobs tend to say “yes,” but it
                            ultimately depends on your preference.

                        <h2>Robusta</h2>
                        <p>Robusta, on the other hand, is grown in Indonesia, Vietnam, India and Brazil. It is known to have
                            a slightly bitter earthy taste. It also has considerably more caffeine than Arabica, and because
                            of that, it's more resilient (apparently
                            pests don't like caffeine!). Robusta is easier to grow: it can grow at lower altitudes and is
                            less vulnerable to weather changes than Arabica. The Robusta coffee plant also produces more
                            coffee per hectare than Arabica (more crop
                            per tree), which makes it cheaper.

                        <p>Liberica is native to Central and Western Africa—specifically, Liberia (hence the name!)—and only
                            makes up approximately 2% of the world's coffee supply. It is almost extinct due to the coffee
                            rust disease, which makes it expensive.
                            Liberica is currently grown in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Liberica beans have a
                            pleasant floral aroma and a subtle woody or smoky flavor.
